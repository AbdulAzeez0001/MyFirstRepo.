My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year
My main academic goal for the coming year is to gain admission into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where I can further develop my passion for robotics, artificial intelligence, and sustainable engineering. I want to be in an environment that challenges me to think critically, collaborate with brilliant minds, and work on innovations that solve real problems across Africa and the world. Getting into MIT isn’t just about earning a degree for me; it’s about joining a community that shares my vision for using technology to create meaningful change.
