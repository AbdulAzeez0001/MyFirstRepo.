Brief Introduction About Myself
I’m Abdul-Azeez Adekunle, a passionate young innovator from Nigeria with a deep interest in technology, social impact, and sustainable development. My journey in STEM began with curiosity about how things work and grew into a drive to create solutions that improve lives. I’ve led projects that combine creativity and purpose, from founding Green Apex, a social enterprise that produces biodegradable sanitary pads to reduce school absenteeism among girls, to developing drones and robotics systems that address real-world challenges.

Beyond engineering, I see technology as a tool for empowerment. Through my organization, Youth Innovators and Inventors Network (YIIN), I mentor young people across Africa, helping them explore robotics, programming, and innovation. Whether mentoring international robotics teams, designing prototypes, or leading community initiatives, I’m driven by one goal: to use innovation to build a more inclusive and sustainable future for Africa.
